In this project I apply google trends data to research 4 distinct data-analysis tasks.

Part 0 - I conduct an analysis of Google Trends. I find the most volatile and seasonally dependent searches.

Part 1 - I use Google Trends data to build linear models which should predict GDP, Inflation and Unemployment based on the searching activity.

Part 2 - I look into correlation between president election results in different US states and searching activity.

Part 3 - I look into the listings of rental offers and flat searching activity
